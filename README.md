# 8-puzzle
the goal of this project is to solve a 8-puzzle
using a* search where the h(x) is calculated 
with manhattan distance and hamming distance
to see the difference is speed and memory usage
# Structure
in astar.py is the a* search algorithm and also the
logic behind generating a solvable puzzle and possible 
movement in the game

in manhatten.py is the manhattan distance value 
calculation and calling the a* search algorithm to 
solve the puzzle with manhattan distance

in hamming.py is the hamming distance value calculation
and calling the a* search algorithm to solve the puzzle
with hamming distance

# Usage
to start the program run the main.py file
